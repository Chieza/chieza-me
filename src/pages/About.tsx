                2002 (6-7 yo): My childhood friend and neighbor got the first
                computer on our block. No internet yet, but my curiosity led me
                to explore Paint almost daily. While my friend drew cartoon
                characters, I meticulously crafted pixel-detailed maps, like the
                map of Brasil. This certainly cultivated my detail-oriented
                side.

                bike 4km almost daily to their house, I first encountered Tibia.
                What amazed me was the possibility of connecting globally and,
                coming from 2D Paint, Tibia's visually detailed 2D world utterly
                enchanted me.

                    2006-2007 (10-11 yo): A few months later, my parents decided
                    to move and it was closer to my cousins, like as neighbors,
                    it meant "deep-dive" into Tibia for me! We dreamed of
                    opening our own Tibia OT (Open Tibia) Server on our home PC
                    with 200kbps internet. This silently birthed my developer
                    side. We editing files, modifying existing code, a
                    foundational step in understanding system logic.

                  <li>
                    2006-2007 (10-11 yo): We discovered Tibia Map Editor, a
                    software to "draw" maps. I started editing Tibia Global
                    maps, then learned to switch OT Server's map to custom-built
                    maps. Hours and hours were spent creating these. Not
                    knowing, this fostered my empathy, designer, and user
                    experience instincts. Adding to that, I was "coding" new
                    game-spells without knowing what "coding" was. I was just
                    doing it.

                    learning organization, code and design, cross-cultural
                    communication, and mastering game mechanics. I earned the
                    nickname "TibiaWiki" for my love of discovering quests, lore
                    and the game mechanics.

                    2020-2022: At C2TI, I quickly progressed from Developer
                    Trainee to UX/UI Designer Trainee and then Product Designer.
                    My proudest project involved redesigning an internal tool,
                    where I led my first User Research, UI Testing, and User
                    Interviews. I was intuitively applying UX principles even
                    before knowing all the formal terms.

                    till Product Designer Analyst. Gained extensive experience
                    helping and then leading design initiatives across diverse
                    industries like ecommerce, retail, health, security,
                    agriculture, logistics... Designing for web, desktop,
                    mobile, smartwatch and embedded systems. I learned how to
                    run projects independently, often as the UX/UI role, that
                    was still maturing within the tech community. Also had my
                    first contact with a international project.

                2023-2025: I participated in two transformative 4-month exchange
                programs in Truckee, CA (Winters 2023/24 & 2024/25). This was a
                life-changing experience where I evolved from an Entry Cook to
                Sub Chef in the second season, gained responsibilities in team
                coordination and problem-solving in high-pressure environments,
                and most importantly, developed profound communication,
                adaptability, and leadership skills in multicultural
                environments. I worked closely with people from Brazil, USA,
                Jamaica, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Costa Rica, Colombia, Paraguay,
                Uruguay, Guam, Hawaii, the list is long... Enriching my cultural
                knowledge and personal growth.

                How am I doing it? With save0d funds from the Exchange Programs,
                I'm now heavily reiforcing my design foundation with studies,
                networking, etc... Actively returning to coding to build my own
                website, showcasing my holistic understanding of product
                development.

                If overseas, I'm open to a Junior role so it allows me to
                solidify my design foundation. My aspiration is to combine
                design and development skills, bridging the gap between design,
                tech teams, and business needs.
